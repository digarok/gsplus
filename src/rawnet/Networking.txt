GS+ can emulate an Uthernet (the original) card in slot 3. Marinetti is supported with the Uthernet Link Layer. Version 1.0.2 or newer is recommended.

Configuration:

In the settings menu, select Ethernet Card Configuration.

Make sure Uthernet Card in Slot 3 is set to On.

Select the Interface menu to choose the selected interface from a menu.

Win32:

Ethernet support uses Winpcap or its modern successor, npcap. You need to install them.

Winpcap/npcap require a hardwired ethernet connection in promiscuous mode -- they work by tapping into the ethernet stream.

Interface names are not particularly meaningful.  Sorry.  Run `getmac /v` from cmd.exe to get a human friendly name for the interface device.

In marinetti, hardcode the ip address, gateway, and dns servers.

OS X:

Ethernet support uses the vmnet framework.  This provides a virtual ethernet device, dhcp server, and dns server, all bridged to the Macintosh's network.

Unfortunately, vmnet requires root permissions or a codesigning entitlment which may only valid for applications through the Mac App Store.

In marinetti, use DHCP.

Linux:

Ethernet support uses the tap ethernet device.  This require setting up the device and bridging it to your local network.
