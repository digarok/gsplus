/**
ATBridge is a limited function AppleTalk bridge that allows GSPort to connect to an
EtherTalk network.  The bridge has two ports, one the emulated LocalTalk port and the
other an EtherTalk Phase II port.  

Due to timing requirements of LocalTalk, it is not reasonable to transparently bridge
LLAP traffic to ELAP.  For example, implementing the lapENQ/lapACK LLAP control packets
requires AARP queries on the ELAP port, which can't be reasonably done within the 200us
LLAP interframe gap.  So, we must implement the local bridge functionality detailed
in "Inside AppleTalk", including AARP, RTMP, ZIP, and DDP routing.
